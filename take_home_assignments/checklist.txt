Checklist for Assignment P5

1) Have you tarred + gzipped the file as XXXXXXXX.tar.gz (your 8-digit roll number) or zipped it to XXXXXXXX.tgz?

I have tarred + gzipped it to CS21B075.P5.tar.gz just like specified.

2) Does your tar.gz / .tgz file expand (by using the command tar xvzf) to the base directory named XXXXXXXX (your 8-digit roll number), and which in turns contains all your files?

Yep it does.


3) Have you removed the a.out files and other generated files from your tar ball?

Here all binaries are removed, we just have the .java files and syntaxtree with the visitor directory.

4) Does the above created compile on the server?

Yep it does.

5) Does your generated P5 take input from Standard Input (for usage of redirection) ?

Yes works.

6) Does your generated P5 write output to Standard Output (for usage of redirection) ?

Yes works.


7) Have you removed all the debugging messages that your program may output?

I hope so ... I'm pretty sure I have. All my tc's passed when I ran it.

8) Is (some part of) the assignment plagiarized?

Nope.

9) Any comments about your evaluation strategy :

Tried to match the outputs from the sample .s files.
None.
