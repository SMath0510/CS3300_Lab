Checklist for Assignment P2

1) Have you tarred + gzipped the file as XXXXXXXX.tar.gz (your 8-digit roll number) or zipped it to XXXXXXXX.tgz?

I have tarred + gzipped it to CS21B076.P2.tar.gz just like specified.

2) Does your tar.gz / .tgz file expand (by using the command tar xvzf) to the base directory named XXXXXXXX (your 8-digit roll number), and which in turns contains all your files?

Yep it does.


3) Have you removed the a.out files and other generated files from your tar ball?

Here all binaries are removed, we just have the .java files and syntaxtree with the visitor directory.

4) Does the above created compile on the server?

Yep it does.

5) Does your generated P2 take input from Standard Input (for usage of redirection) ?

Yes . works

6) Does your generated P2 write output to Standard Output (for usage of redirection) ?

Yes works.


7) Have you removed all the debugging messages that your program may output?

I hope so ... I'm pretty sure I have. All my tc's passed in the server.

8) Is (some part of) the assignment plagiarized?

Nope. Just high level discussion and references.

9) Any comments about your evaluation strategy :

Features incorporated:

1) Trivial typechecking
2) Inheritance of functions and variables from parent classes.
3) Overriding is incorporated, overloading is not allowed.
4) Symbol not found is returned when a certain class doesnt exist in the symbol table OR when a function does not exist in the global hashmap .
5) assignment checking => the LHS can be  a base class and RHS can be a derived class
6) In overriding , function return types can also have a parent child relationship(one way, ancestor class must have the superior return type)
7) Check cycles is done
8) Redefinition is strictly prohibited in the same scope
